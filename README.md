# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradients.  In some cases, gradients might not render correctly across different browsers.  This could be due to browser compatibility or conflicting styles.

## Bug Description

A gradient defined using Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility (or similar) may not render properly.  The gradient might appear broken, incomplete, or entirely missing.  This inconsistency is particularly noticeable across different browsers.

## Solution

The solution may involve checking for CSS conflicts, ensuring that the browser has adequate support for gradients, and potentially using a fallback mechanism in case the gradient fails to render correctly.
